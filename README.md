# ELK Stack Home-Lab

This lab covers setting up a small SOC home lab using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). ELK stack is widely used in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and the lab will provide hands on experience for aspiring SOC analysts.

General Skills Covered:

- Logical diagram creation for network and SOC architecture
- Configuring and using Elastic and Kibana for cybersecurity operations
- Investigating malware and brute-force attack activities
- Creating custom alerts and dashboards for monitoring
- Using cloud environments (e.g., Vultr) to simulate SOC operations

The lab will be a continuous project and is expected to take ~30 days and will be broken down as follows:

<h2>Part 1: ELK Stack</h2>

- Setting up and configuring the ELK stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana)
- Ingesting logs, such as Sysmon, from endpoints into the ELK stack
- Understanding log management and visualization tools

<h2>Part 2: Brute-Force Attack Detection</h2>

- Setting up a public SSH and RDP server for testing
- Detecting and analyzing brute-force attacks
- Creating alerts and dashboards in Kibana to monitor attack activity

<h2>Part 3: Command and Control (C2) Investigations</h2>

- Setting up and using a C2 server with Mythic for simulations
- Attacking public servers to simulate real-world scenarios
- Investigating C2 activity and understanding attacker behavior

<h2>Part 4: Incident Management and Ticketing System Integration</h2>

- Setting up and integrating a ticketing system for incident management
- Conducting investigations based on generated alerts
- Understanding incident documentation and resolution workflows
